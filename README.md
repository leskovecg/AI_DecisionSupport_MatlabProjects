# 🧠 Intelligent Decision Support Systems (Matlab Projects)

This repository contains selected projects developed as part of the course *Intelligent Systems for Decision Support* at the University of Ljubljana (Master's level).

Each project tackles a real-world challenge using AI techniques such as optimization, neural networks, PCA, genetic algorithms, PSO and modeling.

## 📁 Contents

### 📍 Project 1 – Localization using Nonlinear Least Squares  
Locate a lost mobile phone using signals from base stations. Implemented nonlinear least squares optimization in Matlab.

### 📍 Project 2 – Genetic Algorithm for Equation Solving  
Custom GA to evolve mathematical expressions targeting a given numeric result. Uses roulette-wheel selection and symbolic encoding.

### 📍 Project 3 – PCA, LSE & PCR Modeling  
Used PCA and regression techniques to model chemical processes and study multicollinearity, standardization impact and parameter variances.

### 📍 Project 4 – Neural Network Classification with PSO  
Breast cancer classification using a feedforward neural network optimized via Particle Swarm Optimization. Compared results with Matlab's built-in training.

### 📍 Project 5 – Modeling Helio-Crane System  
Built two nonlinear models (neural network & fuzzy) to simulate the Helio-Crane mechanical system and compared performance.

### 📍 Project 6 – Predictive Functional Control  
Implemented a predictive functional regulator using state-space transformations from a fuzzy model of the Helio-Crane system.
